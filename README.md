# Pac-Man Assignment

## Description

This project moves an Atari-inspired Pac-Man icon across the screen while checking page bounds
to cue a change in direction.

## Usage 

Can use with appropriate connecting HTML file as a demo of how to use variables, conditionals, and logical operators.

## Support 

For support, reference the Mozilla Developer Network. 

## Roadmap

In the future, obstacles like walls and other circular objects can be added to make it a more fully functional Pac-Man demo.
