# PacMan-Assignment

Description: This project moves an Atari-inspired Pac-Man icon across the screen while checking page bounds
to cue a change in direction.

Usage: Can use this as a demo of how to use variables, conditionals, and logical operators

Support: For support, the Mozilla Developer network articles on the topics mentioned in "Usage" would be helpful. 

Roadmap: In the future, obstacles can be added to make it a more fully functional Pac-Man demo or game.
